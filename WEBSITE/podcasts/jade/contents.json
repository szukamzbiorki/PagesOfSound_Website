  "description": "<p>The idea for the podcast series Loud Silences, came about by philosophizing about silence, and how it doesn't seem to exist. True silence as in space, where sound cannot travel, could never be achieved on Earth. And even if it would be possible to create that external silence, there would always the internal sounds. Episode 1 is about people with tinnitus, who hate the silence, since it becomes harder for them to ignore the internal sounds.</p>"
