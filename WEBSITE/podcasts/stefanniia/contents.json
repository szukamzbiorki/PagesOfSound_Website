  "description": "<p>My project is based on my personal stories and feelings related to different objects: pants, desk and carpet. MacGuffin magazine 07, 08, 09 were the starting point for my podcasts.<br><br>In my first podcast, pants became an object of my work. What happens when we take off our pants? I reflect on feelings of being undressed, pants off, physical and mental nudity. I also share my posing experience in the anatomy drawing class in the Academy of Arts in Kyiv. In the second podcast, I talk about the feeling that has a relation with the table. Headdesk. I also take as an example a situation when I experienced this feeling in communication with police. In the last episode I tell how I «flew» on a magic carpet as a child. I nostalgic for my childhood and touch on the topic of my origin, the city of the gray zone and the military situation.</p>"
