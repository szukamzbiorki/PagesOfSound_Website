  "description": "<p>This project is based on my personal stories and feelings related to different objects: pants, desk and carpet. These objects were not chosen by chance. These are the single objects with each issue of MacGuffin magazine is based around. This magazine was the starting point for my podcast series.
  <br><br>In my first podcast, pants became an object of my work. What happens when we take off our pants? I reflect on feelings of being undressed, pants off, physical and mental nudity. I also share my posing experience in the anatomy drawing class in the Academy of Arts in Kyiv. In the second podcast, I talk about the feeling that has a relation with the table. Headdesk. I also take as an example a situation when I experienced this feeling in communication with police. In the last episode I tell how I «flew» on a magic carpet as a child. I nostalgic for my childhood and touch on the theme of my origin, the city of the gray zone and the military situation.
