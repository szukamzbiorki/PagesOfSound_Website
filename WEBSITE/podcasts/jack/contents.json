  "description": "<p>My project is about Rutger Bregman's book 'De Meeste mensen deugen', Even though this book is so 'hip' and well known in certain social bubbles I still think it's a very good book from which we as a society can learn a lot form.<br><br>In my podcasts I'm talking to people about certain subjects from the book and try to give our own views on these points. In my publication I tried to give some additional information about the points discussed in the podcasts, in the form of a video combined with text.</p>"
