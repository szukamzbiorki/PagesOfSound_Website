  "description": "<p>The series of podcasts I created is on the topic of ecology, I was inspired by the children's book The Great Adventure of the little whale Sunny. I decided to start the series with a conversation about ecology with me and my partner. In the following episodes, my concept changed progressively, so in the following episodes I decided to do some environmental experiments that you can hear about in the second and third podcasts.The last part of this project was the creation of a book that represents the destruction of the environment, in the book you can see a series of photos which depict various examples of environmental destruction. It is divided into 6 chapters in which you can see selected footage of certain types of waste.</p>"
