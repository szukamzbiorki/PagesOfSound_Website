  "description": "<p>The House is a registration of intuition. The project embodies the house and your features as a living being that symbolise essential aspects to grasp your inner self nature.<br></br>The content was created by personal reflections, notations and experiences, inspired by the magical revolutionary reading of the book Women Who Run With Wolves, Clarissa Pinkola.<br></br>The piece consists first, in a podcast, with three episodes, that follows a linear narrative â€“ the circular journey of intuition. Second, a publication, with four posters, that untangles the meaning of the house. Besides that, the last poster is the fourth episode of this journey, this piece lies on a theatrical performance that concludes the cycle of intuition.</p>"
