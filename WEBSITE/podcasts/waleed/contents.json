Waleed is trying to dig more into this by hosting young Yemeni enthusiasts to create content that can reach out to the world. In three episodes titled 'The Privilege of Being a Yemeni Citizen', 'The View from the Outside', and 'How Does the Future Look Like?', Waleed drinks coffee with Hamza, Bashayer, Shihab and Aziz while they discuss the issues of why Yemenis don't know much about their own culture and the factors that effected Yemen's identity and image including politics and religion. </p>"
