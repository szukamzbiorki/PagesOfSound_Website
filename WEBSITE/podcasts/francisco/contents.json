  "description": "<p>Tomorrow’s Origins is a podcast about indigenous and tribal stories, realities and futures.<br><br>Being raised in Canada, I’ve always been passionate in hearing the voices of tribal and indigenous people as well as the realities they face.<br><br>I am now in the Netherlands, and realised that Europe has very little knowledge on these minorities if any. This podcast serves as a bridge for listeners to understand tribal and indigenous realities worldwide.<br><br>I managed to make this podcast and publication project based on a great book by Stephen Corry titled Tribal Peoples for Tomorrow’s World. This book argues passionately, and controversially, that hunting and nomad-ism are neither backward nor primitive, but intelligent and conscious choices – and that upholding the law and understanding racist prejudice solves most tribal peoples’ problems.<br><br>As individuals, we all learn differently, I had the amazing opportunity to base my work on actual conversations with people that had varied experiences, not just by the words of a book. It’s safe to say that this great book was a starting point for a very cultivated and complete study in the future of these peoples. I’m happy that I could provide a space for the adequate people to shed light on these realities and form this bridge between my community and the rest of the world.</p>"
