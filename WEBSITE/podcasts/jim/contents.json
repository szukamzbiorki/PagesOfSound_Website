  "description": "<p>In my podcast series, I explore the idea of evolving a subject through association. In each episode I start my association with the name of a different animal picked from the book “Reef Creature Identification”.<br><br>In my publication I slightly changed the concept. Here, instead of taking the name of an animal as starting point, I tried to visualise one long string of personal associations.</p>"
