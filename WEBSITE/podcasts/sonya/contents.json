  "description": "<p>In my project I investigated how different a human perception of the world can be, which factors, internal or external, can affect it and are there any similarities between completely different personal experiences. Iâ€™ve done a research on how altered states of mind can be reached by simple physical exercises, usage of psychedelic substances, religious experience and so on, which turned to a journey through the possibilities of human consciousness.</p>"
